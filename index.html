            Silver actually conducts electricity better than gold does. The reason why gold is used in electronics is because silver tarnishes easily while gold does not react with oxygen at all.

        <td colspan="2" class="animated slideInRight"><p>
            Copper and aluminium both form oxide layers but because the layers stop at the surface and protect the rest of the metal from oxidation, this doesn't matter. Their uses in industry do not require the oxide layer to be removed (except for aluminium maybe sometimes) so this property does not affect their usage.

            The high malleability of gold is where the stereotype of biting a gold nugget comes from. It is easy to manipulate for jewelry but is affected by work hardening. Work hardening means that after being bent and formed, gold can become hard and brittle. This is solved by heating it up and letting it cool.

            Gold is frequently used in electronics because of a number of its properties. The first is its high electrical conductivity. The conductivity of gold is so high that it is used as a reference point for other metals. A common measure of conductivity is a percentage of how conductive gold is. The second property is its ductility. Gold has the highest ductility of most other metals and this allows it to be drawn out into very small and thin wires. This is essential as gold is very expensive. The third property is its reactivity. Gold does not react with oxygen or water meaning that exposure to earth atmosphere will not degrade the circuit over time.
        </p><p>
            An example of this is HDMI cables. HDMI cables are used to transfer video information from a device to a screen. The cables are made of copper but the contacts in the plugs at either end are made from gold. The reason for this is that the plug contacts are exposed to air and need to make contact connections. If the contacts were made from copper, the copper would form oxide that would degrade the connection. On the other hand, gold does not react with air or tarnish so the contacts would stay very clean.
        </p></td>
        <td class="animated slideInRight"><p>
            Although silver is not know as a very conductive metal, it matches gold in almost all of its properties. It is more conductive than gold, just as ductile, and just as malleabile. The problem with silver is that it reacts with sulfuric compounds in earth's atmosphere to form a tarnish and degrade. This means that it can't be used in electronics that are open to the air.
        </p><p>
            However, printed circuit boards use silver that is coated in a protective and insulative lacquer. This lacquer prevents the silver from reacting with the atmosphere and degrading.
        </p></td>
        <td class="animated slideInRight"><p>
            Copper is the most common conductor used in electronics. Its high ductility makes it easy to form into wires and its malleability allows it to be flattened into contact pads or electrodes while retaining its shape and not breaking under stress.. Although it forms copper oxide in air, this does not degrade the metal or damage its integrity because the oxide only forms a surface layer. This combined with its low cost and high abundance makes it the best choice for electrical cabling and wires.
        </p><p>
            An example of this can be found in phone lines. Although some phone lines are being converted to fiber optic, phone cables are made out of copper. Although gold is more conductive, gold wires would be way too expensive to mass-produce. Even if the price was not an option, the malleability of gold would make it to weak and likely to snap. On the other hand, copper is relatively cheap and strong enough to withstand the stress involved in putting it in place and manufacturing it.
